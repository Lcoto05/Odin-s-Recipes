<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
	<li>2 cups white rice</li>
	<li>4 cups water</li>
	<li>2/3 cup soy sauce</li>
	<li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
	<li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
	<li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, thinly slived</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
	<li>1 green bell pepper, cut into matchsticks</li>
	<li>1 (8 ounce) can sliced water chestnuts, drained</li>
	<li>1 head broccoli, broken into florets</li>
	<li>1 cup sliced carrots</li>
	<li>1 onion, cut into large chunks</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Bring rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender, and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
	<li>Combine soy sauce, brown sugar, and corn starch in a small bowl; stir until smooth. Mix ginger, garlic, and red pepper into sauce; coat chicken with marinade and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes.</li>
	<li>Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir bell pepper, water chestnuts, broccoli, carrots, and onion until just tender, about 5 minutes. Remove vegetables from skillet and keep warm.</li>
	<li>Remove chicken from marinade, reserving liquid. Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir chicken until slightly pink on the inside, about 2 minutes per side; return vegetables and reserved marinade to skillet. Bring to a boil; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink in the middle and vegetables are tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Serve over rice.</li>
